# WholesomePolice
 WholesomePolice is a discord bot that uses machine learning to identify hate speech sent in discord servers and prompts users to be kind and respectful. It also recognizes discussion related to depression and subsequently sends relevant resources. It can also provide uplifting quotes, news articles, and songs. It was coded entirely in python using discord.py and is hosted on Heroku
